# here we start to create some code in regression

# for every ML code we need 4 Item:
# 1. the most importatn item: a Data set 
# 2. a hypothesis which is a parametric function & our task is finding its parameters
# 3. a cost function which make a relation between "Data Set" & "Parameters of hypothesis"
# 4. an optimization method which optimize the cost function
